# ETL Dashboard Backend (FastAPI)

This Python backend powers the ETL Dashboard feature on my portfolio site. It extracts live product data from an external API, transforms the data by grouping and averaging prices by category, and serves both the raw and aggregated data to the frontend for visualization.
